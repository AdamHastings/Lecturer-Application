When I was in high school I was sitting at lunch with friends and we played a game of "what is the first word you think of when you think of me"

Other friends were things like "goofball" "outgoing" "intelligent"

when it got to me, in unison everyone said "Mormon". I was shocked

It was the first time in my life I felt "othered". It wasn't even how I saw myself---I was a goofball! shy! intelligent! et cetera. But no one saw me that way. 

I was a minority at my high school

I was part of a supermajority at BYU. I've seen things from both perspectives!

I have experience teaching underrepresented groups---half of my class were international students and more than half were women.
